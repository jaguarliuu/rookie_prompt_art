# Privacy Policy

Last updated: April 2, 2025

Thank you for using the **Prompt Art** plugin. Your privacy is important to us. This document describes how we handle your data when using the plugin.

---

## 1. Information Collection

Prompt Art does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information.

- Your input prompts (e.g., questions or topics) are processed temporarily and discarded immediately after generating the SVG output.
- No tracking cookies or analytics are used.
- No data is stored on any server by this plugin.

---

## 2. Data Usage

The plugin only uses your input for generating the SVG image in real-time. Once the SVG is returned, the input and output are not saved or reused in any way.

---

## 3. Security

Because Prompt Art processes data in-memory and does not persist it, there is no risk of data leakage from plugin usage.

---

## 4. Third-Party Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties.

---

## 5. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated over time. The most current version will always be available in the official repository or plugin listing.
