## 1. Information Collection and Use

The Plugin is designed with privacy in mind:

- **Input Data**: Your prompts and inputs are processed temporarily in memory solely for the purpose of generating SVG outputs. These are discarded immediately after processing.
- **No Storage**: We do not store, log, or retain any user inputs or generated outputs.
- **No Tracking**: The Plugin does not use cookies, analytics, or any tracking mechanisms.
- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs locally within your environment; no data is transmitted to external servers.

## 2. Data Security

We implement the following security measures:

- **In-Memory Processing**: Data exists only in volatile memory during active use.
- **No Persistence**: No user data is written to disk or other persistent storage.
- **Isolated Execution**: The Plugin runs in a sandboxed environment when possible.

## 3. Third-Party Services

The Plugin does not integrate with or share data with any third-party services. All processing is self-contained.

## 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. The "Last updated" date at the top indicates when revisions were made. We recommend reviewing this policy periodically.
